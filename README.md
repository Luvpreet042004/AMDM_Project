# IBM-322 Project
The increasing reliance on online job portals and recruitment systems has transformed
the way organizations and individuals connect. With vast amounts of resume data available, automating the job role prediction process has become a crucial need. Predicting
appropriate job roles based on candidatesâ€™ resumes not only streamlines recruitment but
also enhances efficiency for both employers and job seekers.

The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent system capable of analyzing resumes and categorizing candidates into suitable job roles. This involves processing
unstructured text data, extracting meaningful insights, and utilizing machine learning
algorithms to classify resumes into predefined job categories.

The project addresses the following challenges:

Handling diverse resume formats and unstructured textual data. Identifying key skills,
qualifications, and experiences relevant to different roles. Ensuring scalability and accuracy in predicting job roles across various industries. We hypothesize that traditional
methods of resume screening are inefficient and error-prone, and that a robust machine
learning-based solution can effectively enhance the recruitment process by automating
job role predictions with high precision
